I have a family chat where members often like to send voice messages. Often, I do not have the opportunity to listen to them, especially during work. I decided to make a bot to translate voice to text. 

Skills: python

- ðŸ”­ what do i plan to add?
  -   Add function for set up language for users      
  -   Add OCR for image recognition
